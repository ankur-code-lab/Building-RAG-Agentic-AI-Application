An `expected_output` clarifies the desired result format.\n","\n","- **Crew Orchestration:** A Crew object (`support_crew`) assembles the agent and task.

Initial Context & Task Assignment:\n","\n","    - The agent (E-commerce Customer Support Specialist) is assigned the task, which includes the user's query: 'My order ORD456 has been processing for weeks and I can't track it. This is really frustrating!'. This sets the stage and provides the initial information for the agent to reason about.\n","\n","2. Reason/Thought Step:\n","\n","    - Thought: `Thought: The customer is inquiring about the status of their order (ORD456) which has been processing for weeks. This is a request for order status/details, so I will use the 'get_order_details_tool' to retrieve the information about this order.`\n","\n","    - Explanation: This section explicitly shows the Reasoning phase. The agent analyzes the user's query, identifies the core need (order status for ORD456), considers its available tools and their descriptions (implicitly referring back to the task description and tool docstrings), and decides on a plan: use the get_order_details_tool.\n","\n","3. Act/Action Step:\n","\n","    - Using tool: `get_order_details_tool`\n","\n","    - Tool Input: `\"{\\\"order_id\\\": \\\"ORD456\\\"}\"`\n","\n","    - Explanation: This corresponds to the Action phase. Having decided what to do in the reasoning step, the agent now executes that decision. It identifies the specific tool (`get_order_details_tool`) and prepares the necessary input (`{\"order_id\": \"ORD456\"}`) extracted from the query and its reasoning. CrewAI then invokes the actual Python function associated with this tool using this input.\n","\n","4. Observe/Observation Step:\n","\n","    - Tool Output: Order ORD456 Status: Processing. Items: Keyboard. Shipping Address: 456 Oak Ave. Tracking: None\n","\n","    - Explanation: This is the Observation phase. The output shown here is the direct result returned by the executed `get_order_details` tool function. This new piece of information (the actual order status, items, address, and lack of tracking) is now available to the agent.\n","\n","5. Subsequent Reasoning & Final Answer:\n","\n","    - The agent implicitly enters another Reasoning phase after receiving the Tool Output (indicated by Thinking...). It analyzes the Observation (\"Processing\", \"Tracking: None\") in the context of the original query (\"processing for weeks\", \"frustrating\").\n","\n","    - Final Answer: Your order ORD456 is currently processing. The items in your order include a keyboard, and it is being shipped to 456 Oak Ave. Unfortunately, there is no tracking information available at this time. I understand this is frustrating, and I recommend checking back soon for updates.\n","\n","    - Explanation: In this final reasoning step, the agent determines that the information gathered from the tool is sufficient to answer the user's query. It synthesizes the tool's output (\"Processing\", items, address, no tracking) with empathy derived from the user's tone (\"frustrating\") to generate the final response. Since no further actions/tools are needed, it outputs the Final Answer, concluding the ReAct cycle for this task.\n","\n","In summary: The verbose output clearly logs the agent's internal execution cycle, explicitly showing the \"Thought\" (Reasoning), the \"Using tool\" and \"Tool Input\" (Action), and the \"Tool Output\" (Observation). This loop allows the agent to dynamically interact with its tools to gather necessary information before formulating its final response, perfectly illustrating the ReAct paradigm in action."],"metadata":{"id":"Qr2WZxmD4GWm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Print the final result from the crew's execution\n","print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n","print(result)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2kWR5rV83G1I","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1765742392546,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":49,"user":{"displayName":"ankur saxena","userId":"11041009981365514655"}},"outputId":"c07446f7-c4bd-4fa6-c9cf-154325730402"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Final Answer:\n","I've checked on the status of your order ORD456.
