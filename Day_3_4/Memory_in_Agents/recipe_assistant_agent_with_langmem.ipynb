      "\n",
      "1. **Hard‑boil the eggs**  \n",

      "   * Bring to a gentle boil, then cover, remove from heat, and let stand 10–12 min.  \n",

      "2. **Peel and slice**  \n",

      "   * Gently scoop out the yolks into a bowl and set the whites aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Make the filling**  \n",
      "   * Mash the yolks with a fork until smooth.  \n",
      "   * Add Dijon mustard, mayo, vinegar, pepper, and salt.  \n",
      "   * Mix until creamy and well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fill the whites**  \n",
      "   * Spoon or pipe the filling back into the egg whites.  \n",
      "   * For a cleaner look, use a piping bag or a plastic sandwich bag with the corner snipped off.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Garnish & chill**  \n",
      "   * Sprinkle paprika over the tops.  \n",
      "   * Optional: add a few chopped chives or dill for a fresh herbal note.  \n",
      "   * Refrigerate for at least 30 min before serving to allow flavors to meld.\n",

      "6. **Serve**  \n",
