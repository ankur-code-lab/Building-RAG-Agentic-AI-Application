      "| Goal | How to hit it |\n",
      "|------|---------------|\n",
      "| **Calorie deficit** | Aim for ~500–750 kcal below maintenance. Use an online calculator or the “rule of 15” (subtract 15 kcal per pound of body weight) to estimate maintenance. |\n",
      "| **Protein** | 1.5–2 g per lb of body weight (≈3.3–4.4 g/kg). Keeps muscle mass while you’re in a deficit. |\n",
      "| **Carbs** | 30–40 % of total calories. Focus on complex carbs around workouts. |\n",
      "| **Fats** | 20–25 % of total calories. Prioritize unsaturated fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil). |\n",
      "| **Meal timing** | 4–5 meals per day, with protein in each. Pre‑ and post‑workout windows (30–60 min) are key for recovery. |\n",
      "| **Hydration** | 3–4 L/day (adjust for sweat loss). |\n",

      "| Focus | Frequency | Example Split |\n",

      "| **Cardio** | 2–3 days | 20–30 min HIIT or steady‑state (e.g., 30 min brisk walk) |\n",
      "| **Core & Mobility** | 2–3 days | 10‑min core circuit + 10‑min mobility routine |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key points:**\n",
      "- **Progressive overload**: add weight or reps each week.\n",
      "- **Compound lifts** (squat, deadlift, bench, overhead press) build the most muscle.\n",
